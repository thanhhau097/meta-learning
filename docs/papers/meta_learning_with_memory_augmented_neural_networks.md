# meta_learning_with_memory_augmented_neural_networks.md
## What?
- A memory-augmented neural network that can use the external memory to store the knowledge
## Why?
- Almost neural network just stores the internal memory, such as RNN, LSTM, etc.
## How?
- Incorporate Neural Turing Machine 
- Use Least Recently Used Access to write to memory, which can emphasize a conjunctive coding of information independent of sequence.

## Results? (What did they find?)
- Useful for few-shot learning problem
- Use external memory for neural network
## Ideas to improve?
