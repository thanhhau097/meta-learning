# hyper_parameters

In these methods Ï‰ includes hyperpa- rameters of the base learning algorithm such as regulariza- tion strength [25], per-parameter regularization [92], task- relatedness in multi-task learning [67], or sparsity strength in data cleansing [67]. Note that hyperparameters such as step size and direction [75], [76] can be seen as part of definition of the optimizer, and as such leads to an overlap between hyper-parameter and optimizer learning categories.
