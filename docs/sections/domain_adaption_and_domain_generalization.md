# domain_adaption_and_domain_generalization
Domain-shift refers to the situation where source and
target tasks have the same classes but the input distribution of the target task is shifted with respect to the source task [34], [57], leading to reduced model performance upon transfer. DA is a variant of transfer learning that attempts to alleviate this issue by adapting the source-trained model using sparse or unlabeled data from the target. DG refers to methods to train a source model to be robust to such domain-shift without further adaptation. Many methods have been studied [34], [57], [58] to transfer knowledge and boost performance in the target domain. However, as for TL, vanilla DA and DG are differentiated in that there is no meta-objective that optimizes ‘how to learn’ across domains. Meanwhile, meta-learning methods can be used to perform both DA and DG, which we cover in section 5.9.
