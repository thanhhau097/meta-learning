# other_episode_design_factors
Other operators can be inserted into the episode generation pipeline to customize meta-learning for particular applications. For example one can simulate domain-shift between training and validation to meta-optimize for good performance under domain-shift [44], [92]; simulate network compression such as quantiza- tion [187] between training and validation to meta-optimize for good network compressibility; provide noisy labels dur- ing meta-training to optimize for label-noise robustness [93], or generate an adversarial validation set to meta-optimize for adversarial defense [94]. These opportunities are ex- plored in more detail in the following applications section.
