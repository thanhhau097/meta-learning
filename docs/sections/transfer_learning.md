# transfer_learning

TL [34] uses past experience of a source task to improve learning (speed, data efficiency, accuracy) on a target task â€“ by transferring a parameter prior, initial condition, or feature extractor [56] from the solution of a previous task. TL refers both to this endeavour to a problem area. In contemporary neural network context it often refers to a particular methodology of parameter transfer plus optional fine tuning (although there are nu- merous other approaches to this problem [34]). While TL can refer to a problem area, meta-learning 
refers to a methodology which can be used to improve TL as well as other problems. TL as a methodology is differentiated to meta-learning as the prior is extracted by vanilla learning on the source task without the use of a meta-objective. In meta-learning, the corresponding prior would be defined by an outer optimization that evaluates how well the prior performs when helping to learn a new task, as illustrated, e.g., by MAML [19]. More generally, meta-learning deals with a much wider range of meta- representations than solely model parameters (Section 4.1).
