# continual_learning

Continual and lifelong learning [59], [60] refer to the ability to learn on a sequence of tasks drawn from a potentially non-stationary distribution, and in particular seek to do so while accelerating learning new tasks and without forgetting old tasks. It is related insofar
as working with a task distribution, and that the goal is partly to accelerate learning of a target task. However most continual learning methodologies are not meta-learning methodologies since this meta objective is not solved for explicitly. Nevertheless, meta-learning provides a potential framework to advance continual learning, and a few recent studies have begun to do so by developing meta-objectives that encode continual learning performance [61]â€“[63].
