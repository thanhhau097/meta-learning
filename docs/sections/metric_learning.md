# metric_learning

Metric-learning or non-parametric algo- rithms are thus far largely restricted to the popular but spe- cific few-shot application of meta-learning (Section 5.1.1). The idea is to perform non-parametric ‘learning’ at the inner (task) level by simply comparing validation points with training points and predicting the label of matching training points. In chronological order, this has been achieved with methods such as siamese networks [85], matching networks [86], prototypical networks [20], relation networks [87], and graph neural networks [88]. Here the outer-level learning corresponds to metric learning (finding a feature extractor ω that encodes the data to a representation suitable for comparison). As before ω is learned on source tasks, and used for target tasks.
