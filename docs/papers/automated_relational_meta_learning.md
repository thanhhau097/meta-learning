# automated_relational_meta_learning.md
## What?
- automated relational meta-learning (ARML) framework that automat- ically extracts the cross-task relations and constructs the meta-knowledge graph
## Why?
- the task heterogeneity which cannot be well handled by traditional globally shared meta-learning methods. 
## How?
- Propose using graph to store the meta-knowledge, this knowledge will be constructed automatically and used to extract 
the relation information.

## Results? (What did they find?)
- better performance compare to original MAML
## Ideas to improve?
- Use this graph with MAML++
