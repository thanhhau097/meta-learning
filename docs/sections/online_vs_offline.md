# online_vs_offline
While the classic meta-learning
pipeline defines the meta-optimization as an outer-loop of the inner base learner [19], [78], some studies have at- tempted to preform meta-optimization online within a single base learning episode [44], [167], [185], [186]. In this case the base model θ and learner ω co-evolve during a single episode. Since there is now no set of learning operations to amortize over, meta-learning needs to be fast compared to base model learning in order to benefit sample or compute efficiency
