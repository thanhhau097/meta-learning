# auto_ml

AutoML [31], [32] is a rather broad umbrella for approaches aiming to automate parts of the machine learning process that are typically manual, such as data preparation and cleaning, feature selection, algorithm se- lection, hyper-parameter tuning, architecture search, and so on. AutoML often makes use of numerous heuristics outside the scope of meta-learning as defined here, and addresses tasks such as data cleaning that are less central to meta-learning. However, AutoML sometimes makes use of meta-learning as we define it here in terms of end-to-end optimization of a meta-objective, so meta-learning can be seen as a specialization of AutoML.
