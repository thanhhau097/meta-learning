# task_families

Many existing meta-learning frameworks, especially for few-shot learning, require task families for
meta-training. While this indeed reflects lifelong human learning, in some applications data for such task families may not be available. How to relax this assumption is an ongoing challenge. Unsupervised meta-learning [247]â€“[249] and online meta-learning methods [44], [162], [167], [168], [185], could help to alleviate this; as can improvements in meta-generalization discussed above.
