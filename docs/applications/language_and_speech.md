**Language Modelling**. Few-shot language modelling has been a popular way to showcase the versatility of meta- learners, with early methods like matching networks show- ing impressive performances on one-shot tasks such as filling in missing words [86]. Many more tasks have since been tackled, including neural program induction [261] and synthesis [262], English to SQL program synthesis [263], text-based relationship graph extractor [264], machine translation [265], and quickly adapting to new personas in dialogue tasks [266].

**Speech Recognition** Deep learning is now established as the dominant paradigm for state of the art automatic speech recognition (ASR). Meta-learning is beginning to be applied to address the many few-shot adaptation problems that arise within ASR including learning how to train for low-resource languages [267], cross-accent adaptation [268] and optimising models for individual speakers [269].
