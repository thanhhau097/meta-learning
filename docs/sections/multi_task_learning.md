# multi_task_learning

Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to jointly learn several related tasks, and benefits from the effect regularization due to parameter sharing and of the diversity of the resulting shared representation [64]â€“[66]. Like TL, DA, and CL, con- ventional MTL is a single-level optimization without a meta- objective. Furthermore, the goal of MTL is to solve a fixed number of known tasks, whereas the point of meta-learning is often to solve unseen future tasks. Nonetheless, meta- learning can be brought in to benefit MTL, e.g. by learning the relatedness between tasks [67], or how to prioritise among multiple tasks [68].
