## What?
- Neural Network Turing Machine 
- differentiable end-to- end, allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent
## Why?
- intergrate the memory into neural network
## How?
(read the paper)
## Results? (What did they find?)
- better than LSTM in some task such as: copy, recall, sorting,...
## Ideas to improve?
