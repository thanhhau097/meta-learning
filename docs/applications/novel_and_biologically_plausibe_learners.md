# novel_and_biologically_plausibe_learners

Most meta-learning work that uses an explicit (non feed- forward/black-box) optimization for the base model is based on gradient descent by backpropagation (as is most conventional deep learning work). An intriguing possibility for meta-learning is to define the function class of learning rules Ï‰ so as to lead to the discovery of novel effective learning rules that are potentially unsupervised [21], bi- ologically plausible [47], [259], [260] making use of ideas less commonly used in contemporary deep learning such as Hebbian updates [259] and neuromodulation [260].
