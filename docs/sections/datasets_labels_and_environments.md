Perhaps the
strangest choice of meta-representation is the support dataset itself. This departs from our initial formalization of meta-learning which considers the source datasets to be fixed (Section 2.1, Eqs. 2-3). However, it can be easily understood in the bilevel view of Eqs. 5-6. If the validation set in the upper optimization is real and fixed, and a train set in the lower optimization is paramaterized by ω, the training dataset can be tuned by meta-learning to optimize validation performance. In dataset distillation [144], [145], the support images
themselves are learned such that a few steps on them allows for good generalization on real query images. This can be used to summarize large datasets into a handful of images, which is useful for replay in continual learning where streaming datasets cannot be stored. Rather than learning the input images x for fixed labels
y, one can also learn the input labels y for fixed images x. This can be used in semi-supervised learning, for example to directly learn the unlabeled set’s labels to optimize vali- dation set performance [146], or to train a label generation function [147].
In the case of sim2real learning [148] in computer vision
or reinforcement learning, one uses an environment sim- ulator to generate data for training. In this case one can also train the graphics engine [149] or simulator [150] so as to optimize the real-data (validation) performance of the downstream model after training on data generated by that environment simulator.
